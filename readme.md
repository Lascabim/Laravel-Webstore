# Laravel Website

## Project Itself

This project is a Online Store example using framework Laravel, testing my coding skills. 
It´s fully responsive and has API´s such as whatsapp direct message to contact directly the owner of the shop.
I hope you can learn something from this, and motivate you to do something yourself! 

## How to run the project

Download the project, copy the file

```
.env.example

## Open your cmd in the folder and run the following commands:

```
composer update

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

And now to run the server execute:

```
php artisan serve
```

Have fun !
